This is a repository for all Kontent.ai's CustEd scripts for Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey. The repository is primarily focused on Kontent.ai's internal employees' needs but does not exclude any usage outside the company. Feel free to use or fork the scripts to your liking.

## Bugs and ideas
Sorry to hear that. Just log a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Kontent-ai-Learn/tampermonkey-scripts/issues) and someone will take a look at it. Remember, the more information you provide, the easier it will be to fix the issue. If you feel like it, you can also fix the bug on your own and submit a new pull request. As this repository is focused on Kontent.ai's employees, there is no official bug-fixing policy or a guaranteed response time.

## Contributions
